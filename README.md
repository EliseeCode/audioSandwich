# Getting Started with AudioSandwitch

This project was bootstrapped with [Crunker](https://github.com/jackedgson/crunker).

This project goal is to ease the audio production of the exam subject for french exam (DELF, DALF).

You can chose one or several pre-recorded sounds, import one or several audio files from your computer or phone, or add silences.
Reorder audio element as you wish, preview the final audio merge where files will be concatenanted one after another

After previewing the result, you can download it as mp3 file.
